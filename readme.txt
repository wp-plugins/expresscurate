ExpressCurate simplifies and expedites content curation and provides SEO optimization and keyword effectiveness monitoring.

== Description ==

The ExpressCurate content curation plugin is a WordPress platform for creating, optimizing, and publishing high-quality content.  

While there are many content discovery tools, the process of curation in WordPress is still convoluted and confusing, requiring multiple steps and manually switching back and forth between screens, plug-ins, and programs.

ExpressCurate solves this problem by bringing all the key elements for content curation onto a single screen, making content curation in WordPress intuitive and quick! It combines the three essential content curation components -- content, keywords, and SEO -- in a single plugin. It includes
1. **Composer/Editor** to streamline the process of writing a curated post
1. **Keyword Dashboard** for centrally storing and updating your keywords as well as for monitoring their usage within your blog/site content
1. **SEO Control Center** for streamlining the creation of important SEO components associated with your posts, such as meta descriptions, keywords, and tags.



= Curated Post Composer and Editor Features =

1. **Quickstart Button.** Start a curated post with a single click of the Curate Content Button next to the standard Add Media.
1. **Original Content Preloading.** Just specify the target URL of an article that you want to curate, and ExpressCurate will auto-populate the content into your post, making it easier and faster for you to edit and post an article.
1. **Image Slider.** ExpressCurate can pick up images from the original post, making it easy to add a graphical element to your curated content.
1. **Duplicate Content Check.** ExpressCurate provides a warning if the same URL has been used in a prior article in your blog, helping you to prevent a potential double-curation.
1. **Multi-source Curation --** curate content from multiple sources and web pages in a single article.
1. **Content-aware tag suggestions based on the keywords and tags defined in your prior WordPress blogs.**
1. **Automatic hashtagging whenever # is used**
1. **Google Authorship**

 
 
= Keywords Summary and Dashboard Features =

1. **Keywords Summary.** Get a content-effectiveness summary for the keywords you are targeting, including how often they show up in your titles and text and the number of posts containing them.
1. **Most Frequently Used Words.** Use the ExpressCurate Keywords Dashboard to find out the most frequently used words on your blog. This can give you new keyword directions or ideas on how to optimize your content for better results with the current keywords.
1. **Keywords Center.** A centralized place to keep your keywords and keyphrases.  
1. **Keyword Discovery.** Add new keywords/keyphrases and see their occurrence frequency in your blog content. You can also click on the "+" icon next to the words from the "most frequently used words" list to add to your target keywords list.
1. **Keyword-targeted Posts.** Should you decide to create a post that is focused around a certain keyword/keyphrase from the keyword center, just click on the "add post" icon next to it. This will start a new post with hints focused around the usage of your target keywords in the post.  
 
 
 
= SEO Control Center Features =

1. **SEO Control Center.** Enter all SEO-related information for your new post on the same page you are composing/editing your curated post.
