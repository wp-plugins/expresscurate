ExpressCurate simplifies and expedites your content curation in WordPress.

== Description ==

ExpressCurate simplifies and expedites your content curation in WordPress.

While there are many tools for finding content, the process of curation in WordPress is still convoluted and confusing, requiring multiple steps and manual switching back and forth between screens and programs.
 
ExpressCurate solves that problem by bringing all key elements for content curation onto a single *screen*, making content curation in WordPress intuitive and quick!

**Features**:

1. **Quickstart Button**. Starting a curated post is as simple as clicking on the **Curate Content** Button next to the standard **Add Media**.
1. **Original Content Preloading**. Just specify the target URL of an article you want to curate from.  ExpressCurate will auto-populate the content into your post, making it easier and faster for you to edit and post an article.
1. **Image Slider**. ExpressCurate can pick up images from the original post, making it easy to add a graphical element to your curated content.
1. **SEO Control Center**. Enter key page attributes and SEO enhancements from a single page. (e.g. keywords, meta descriptions,  h1/h2/h3 tags paragraphs)
1. **Duplicate Content Check**. ExpressCurate provides a warning if the same URL has been used for a prior article in your blog, helping you prevent a potential double-curation. 

**Additional Features**:

1. Content-aware tag suggestions based on the keywords and tags defined in your prior WordPress blogs.
1. Automatic hashtagging whenever # is used
1. Top sites for curated content -- with a number of articles curated from each site
1. Customizable attribution text for original article Link
1. Multi-source Curation -- curate content from multiple sources and web pages into a single article.
